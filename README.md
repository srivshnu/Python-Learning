# Python-Learning
A collection of my Python learning progress based on the 30DaysOfPython repository by Asabeneh (https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python) and the Python Skill-Up course from GeeksforGeeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/python-skill-up).

This repository includes my notes, exercises, and several improved explanations, tables, and examples to make the concepts clearer and more beginner-friendly.

DAY-1 : Basic operations, variables, data types and syntaxes

DAY-2 : Execution programs for built-in functions

DAY-3 : Arithmetic, Assignment Comparision, logical, identity, memebership and bitwise operators
